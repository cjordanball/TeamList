# TeamList
A simple program to display a sorted list of team members.

To run this program, download the repository and from this directory run a server, such as http-server (look on npm) and open your browser and type "localhost:8080" (unless you have designated another port, of course).  You should see a button, which upon clicking will present and alphabetized list of names.  You only get one press, however, because the button disables upon the first click.
